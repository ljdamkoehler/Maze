CREDIT: I completed this project in a course taught by Stephen Grider.
This is a simple maze made using recursive algorithms and matter.js. 
It was a create learning experience and I have already implemented the things I learned here in other projects. I would highly recommend Stephenâ€™s courses and this project to beginners.
